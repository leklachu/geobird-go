What is the logic of outputs (and actions) depending on:
- dry-run

- file exists

File does not exist, full verbosity:

- "putting File
- run thing and pring any errors

File exist, full verb:
- "get
- "put
- "but already there

Verb 0:
- if exist/dry, break
Verb 1:
- if exist/dry, break
- "putting
Verb 2:
- "get
- "put
- if exist/dry "there/dry" and break
